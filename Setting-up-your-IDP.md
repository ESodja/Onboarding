# Individual Development Plan Summary

:memo: Developing an Individual Development Plan will guide you towards your career goals. You will acquire the skills and experience you need by setting achievable short- and intermediate-term goals.

:alarm_clock: I would also suggest you adopt a time management tool to help you manage your time and ensure you are continuously advancing your goals. There's a variety of different methods for time management, and if you have an approach that works for you, please share them with the group! Currently, Noelle is using an approach developed by Dr. Karin Kettering to keep track of short- and long-term research goals on a weekly basis - ask Noelle to see it.

## Building your IDP

Either fill out one of the templates provided for [graduate students](https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/current/development/idp) or [postdocs](https://postdoc.unl.edu/current/idp_review/) provided by the University of Nebraska or the [web-based career-planning tool](http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/) provided by *Science*, and share the results with Noelle. Also see advice on goal setting from [USU's Academic Success Center](https://www.usu.edu/asc/assistance/pdf/goal_setting.pdf).

## Summarize your IDP
Create a file in the [Project Management](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/ProjectManagement) repository called `IDP.md` inside a folder with your name (don't put a space, use a hypen to separate your first and last name(s)). This will be the same folder in which you add your weekly reflections.

Inside that file, copy the template below that summarizes your IDP results. It's in markdown format and you might find this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) useful for getting started.
